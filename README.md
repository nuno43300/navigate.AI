Navigate.AI is a travel assistance system that uses artificial intelligence (AI), this project is developed in the programming language "Python" and uses "Deep Learning" through the frameworks "PyTorch".

# Objectives
The main objective of this project is to create an artificial intelligence capable of guiding a car (in this case, a simulator, I will be using CARLA) managing to keep the car centered between lanes, avoid collisions, respect traffic signs, detect pedestrians and be able to maintain speed control, as well how to alert the lane change using the car turn signals, all automatically.
With this project I also intend to gain new knowledge as well as learn to work with artificial intelligence and learn the programming language “Python” and thus increase my knowledge of programming.
